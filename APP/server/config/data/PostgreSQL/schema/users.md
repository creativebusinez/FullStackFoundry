# User-related Schema

A "used across the board" user-related schema in PostgreSQL typically involves tables and relationships that manage user information and authentication. Here's an example of a simple user-related schema that can be used across various applications, such as social networks, e-commerce platforms, or content management systems:

```sql
-- Table for User Accounts
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    registration_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table for User Profiles
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    profile_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT UNIQUE,
    profile_picture_url VARCHAR(255),
    bio TEXT,
    website VARCHAR(255),
    social_links JSONB,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Table for User Roles
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    role_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    role_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Table for User Sessions (for authentication)
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    session_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expiration_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

In this schema:

- The `users` table stores user account information, including usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, full names, date of birth, and registration dates.

- The `user_profiles` table allows users to have additional profile information, such as profile pictures, bios, website URLs, and social media links. It is related to the `users` table by the `user_id` field.

- The `user_roles` table can be used for role-based access control. It associates users with different roles, allowing for fine-grained permission management.

- The `user_sessions` table is used for user authentication and storing session tokens. It helps users stay authenticated between requests.

This schema provides a foundation for managing user-related data and authentication in a PostgreSQL database. Depending on your application's requirements, you can expand upon this schema by adding more tables or fields, such as user preferences, user-generated content, or additional authentication methods.

## Additional Schema Considerations

Depending on your application's complexity and requirements, you can expand the user-related schema in PostgreSQL by adding more tables and relationships. Here are some additional components you can consider adding to your schema:

1. **User Addresses:**
   - Create a table to store user addresses, including shipping and billing addresses.

2. **User Preferences:**
   - Include a table for user preferences, where users can customize their account settings, such as notification preferences or theme choices.

3. **User Activity Logs:**
   - Maintain logs of user activities and interactions with your application. This can help with auditing and user behavior analysis.

4. **User Comments and Reviews:**
   - If your application allows users to leave comments or reviews, create tables to store this user-generated content, associated with the user who posted it.

5. **User Relationships:**
   - Implement a system for users to connect with each other, such as friend requests or followers/following relationships. Store these relationships in a separate table.

6. **User Transactions and Orders:**
   - If your application involves e-commerce or financial transactions, create tables to manage user orders, payments, and transaction history.

7. **User Notifications:**
   - Track notifications sent to users, including delivery status and read/unread status.

8. **User Sessions History:**
   - Store historical data about user sessions, including login/logout timestamps, IP addresses, and devices used for authentication.

9. **User Activity Scores:**
   - Calculate and store user activity scores or points based on their interactions with your application. This can be used for gamification or rewards systems.

10. **User Verification and Security:**
    - Implement tables for user verification methods, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) settings, and track security-related events like password changes.

11. **User Email and Messaging:**
    - If your application involves messaging or email communication, create tables to store messages, conversations, and email logs.

12. **User Devices:**
    - Keep track of the devices users use to access your application for security and account recovery purposes.

13. **User Groups or Communities:**
    - If your application supports user-created groups or communities, design tables to manage group memberships and discussions.

14. **User Feedback and Support Tickets:**
    - Allow users to submit feedback or support requests and store them for response and tracking.

15. **User Reports and Moderation:**
    - Implement mechanisms for users to report inappropriate content or behavior, and create tables to manage reports and moderation actions.

16. **User Analytics Data:**
    - Store user-related analytics data, such as page views, click-through rates, or conversion metrics.

17. **User Content Uploads:**
    - If your application allows users to upload content (e.g., images, documents), create tables to manage user-uploaded files.

Remember that the structure of your user-related schema should align with the specific needs of your application and its features. Carefully plan and design the schema to ensure data integrity, security, and scalability as your application grows. Additionally, always consider data privacy regulations and best practices when handling user data.
