Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development to automate testing, build, and deployment processes. Here's a high-level list of CI/CD tools and platforms commonly used in the industry:

**Continuous Integration (CI) Tools:**

1. **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that supports building, testing, and deploying code. Jenkins offers a wide range of plugins and integrations.

2. **Travis CI**: A cloud-based CI service that automates the testing and deployment of GitHub-hosted repositories. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use.

3. **CircleCI**: A cloud-based CI/CD platform that integrates with popular version control systems and offers container-based builds for faster testing and deployment.

4. **GitLab CI/CD**: Integrated within GitLab, it provides built-in CI/CD pipelines, auto-devops, and container registry features.

5. **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's built-in CI/CD solution that allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repositories.

6. **TeamCity**: A powerful CI/CD server by JetBrains with support for various build tools, version control systems, and extensive customization options.

7. **Bamboo**: Atlassian's CI/CD server that integrates with other Atlassian products like Jira and Bitbucket.

8. **Drone**: An open-source CI/CD platform that is container-native and can be self-hosted or used as a cloud service.

9. **Codeship**: A cloud-based CI/CD platform that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for automating software delivery.

10. **Semaphore**: A CI/CD platform that supports parallel testing and deployment pipelines, along with integrations for popular development tools.

11. **Azure DevOps Services**: A suite of DevOps tools by Microsoft that includes CI/CD pipelines, code repositories, and project management features.

12. **AppVeyor**: A CI/CD service that specializes in Windows-based builds and deployments, often used for .NET projects.

**Continuous Deployment (CD) and Deployment Automation Tools:**

1. **Docker**: A containerization platform that simplifies application deployment and enables consistency across different environments.

2. **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

3. **Spinnaker**: An open-source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that simplifies deploying applications to various cloud providers.

4. **Heroku**: A cloud platform that simplifies application deployment by handling infrastructure management and scaling.

5. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from AWS that automates application deployment and scaling.

6. **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Google Cloud's managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration and deployment.

7. **Netlify**: A cloud platform that automates the deployment of static websites and serverless functions.

8. **Vercel**: A platform for deploying web applications, especially front-end projects, with features like serverless functions and automatic deployments from Git repositories.

9. **Octopus Deploy**: A deployment automation tool that focuses on simplifying the deployment process for .NET applications and other technologies.

10. **Capistrano**: A deployment automation tool that simplifies the deployment of web applications to multiple servers or environments.

The choice of CI/CD tools and platforms depends on factors like your project's technology stack, hosting environment, complexity, and integration requirements. CI/CD practices aim to improve development workflows by automating repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors, and enabling rapid and reliable software delivery.
