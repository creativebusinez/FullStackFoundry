# Containerization and Virtualization

Containerization and virtualization technologies are essential for managing and deploying applications and services in isolated environments. Here's a high-level list of containerization and virtualization technologies commonly used in software development and IT operations:

**Containerization Technologies:**

1. **Docker**: The most widely adopted containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers for easy deployment and management.
