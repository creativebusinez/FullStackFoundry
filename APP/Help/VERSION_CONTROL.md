Version control is fundamental to managing code and collaborative software development. Here's a high-level list of version control systems (VCS) and related tools commonly used in software development:

1. **Git**: A distributed version control system that is one of the most widely used VCS in the software development industry. Git is known for its speed, flexibility, and robust branching and merging capabilities.

2. **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It provides features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews, making it popular for open-source and collaborative projects.

3. **GitLab**: A web-based platform similar to GitHub but available as both a cloud-based service and a self-hosted solution. GitLab offers a complete DevOps platform with built-in CI/CD, container registry, and more.

4. **Bitbucket**: A Git and Mercurial code hosting and collaboration platform by Atlassian. It offers features like Jira integration and built-in CI/CD pipelines.

5. **Subversion (SVN)**: A centralized version control system that allows developers to track changes to files and directories over time. It's still used in some legacy projects.

6. **Mercurial**: A distributed version control system similar to Git, designed for simplicity and ease of use. It's used in various software development projects.

7. **Perforce (Helix Core)**: A centralized version control system designed for managing large codebases and binary assets, often used in the gaming and enterprise software industries.

8. **TFS (Team Foundation Server)**: A version control and application lifecycle management system by Microsoft. It's integrated with Visual Studio and Azure DevOps.

9. **AWS CodeCommit**: A managed source code control service provided by AWS, compatible with Git repositories.

10. **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)**: A centralized version control system, mainly used in older software projects.

11. **Darcs**: A distributed version control system that emphasizes a unique patch-based approach to version control.

12. **Plastic SCM**: A distributed version control system with a focus on branching and merging. It supports various workflows and is used in game development and other industries.

13. **SourceTree**: A graphical Git and Mercurial client for Windows and macOS that provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories.

14. **Rational ClearCase**: A centralized version control system by IBM, suitable for managing large-scale software projects.

15. **Fossil**: A distributed version control system with an integrated bug tracker, wiki, and web interface. It's known for its simplicity.

16. **AWS CodeCommit**: A managed source control service provided by AWS, compatible with Git repositories.

17. **VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services)**: Now known as Azure DevOps Services, it provides version control, build automation, release management, and other DevOps-related features.

18. **Gitea**: A self-hosted Git service that is lightweight, easy to set up, and suitable for small to medium-sized teams.

19. **Kiln**: A version control system by Fog Creek Software that is based on Mercurial and offers code review and collaboration features.

20. **Bazaar**: A distributed version control system designed for ease of use and suitable for both centralized and decentralized workflows.

The choice of version control system depends on factors like project size, team preferences, collaboration needs, and integration with other development tools. Git, with its strong community and vast ecosystem, remains the most popular choice in modern software development.
