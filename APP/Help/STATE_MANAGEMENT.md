As of 2023, several state management libraries have emerged as popular choices for web development, particularly for managing application states in frameworks like React. Here's a summary of some of the top state management libraries:

1. **Redux**: Known for borrowing heavily from functional programming concepts, Redux is appreciated for its lightweight nature and predictable state management. It's highly popular due to its extensive use in various projects and its compatibility with many UI libraries and frameworks【61†source】【63†source】.

2. **MobX**: This library takes a different approach to state management, using the observer/observables pattern. It's known for its reactivity and ability to manage state without actions or reducers. MobX is particularly notable for its usability, performance, and scalability【63†source】.

3. **Recoil**: Designed for seamless integration with existing React projects, Recoil provides advanced state management features with a focus on atoms and selectors. It's known for its ease of integration and effective handling of shared state【62†source】.

4. **Vuex (Vue.js)**: Specifically designed for Vue.js, Vuex is an official Flux-like implementation for managing state in Vue applications. It's known for its modular structure and the ability to share and feed state into different components【61†source】.

5. **RxJS**: This library is recognized for its power in implementing both simple and complex UI logic. RxJS is especially useful for developers experienced in functional-reactive programming【61†source】.

6. **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)**: SWR is a library used for asynchronous development. It adopts a Stale-While-Revalidate strategy, serving users cached data while updating in the background, making it efficient for data retrieval and reducing network requests【62†source】.

7. **Jotai**: Jotai offers an innovative approach to atomic state management, handling state like atoms and offering scalability and simplicity【63†source】.

8. **Rematch**: Known for its lighter, faster, and easier-to-use features, Rematch simplifies setup, reduces boilerplate, and handles side effects better. It's compatible with multiple frameworks and is easy to learn【63†source】.

9. **Zustand**: Zustand stands out for its minimalistic API and efficiency in overcoming common issues in React like the zombie child problem. It's known for its high performance and ease of use【63†source】.

10. **Formik**: Formik is widely used for form management in React applications, offering built-in state management, data validation, error handling, and performance optimization【62†source】.

These libraries offer different approaches to state management, catering to various needs and preferences in web development. The choice of library often depends on the specific requirements of the project, the development framework in use, and the developer's familiarity with the library.
