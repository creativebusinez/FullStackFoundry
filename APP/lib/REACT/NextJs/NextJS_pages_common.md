In a Next.js application, the `/pages` directory reflects the routing structure of the app, with each file or directory corresponding to a route. Here's an example of commonly named pages you might find in a typical project, along with their respective file paths and a brief description of each:

```
/next-app
|-- /pages
    |-- index.tsx                 (Home Page)
    |-- about.tsx                 (About Us Page)
    |-- contact.tsx               (Contact Page)
    |-- services.tsx              (Services Page)
    |-- blog
    |   |-- index.tsx             (Blog Listing Page)
    |   |-- [slug].tsx            (Individual Blog Post Page)
    |-- products
    |   |-- index.tsx             (Products Listing Page)

    |-- login.tsx                 (Login Page)
    |-- register.tsx              (Registration Page)
    |-- user
