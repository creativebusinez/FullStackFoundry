Vite, a versatile and modern build tool that supports multiple front-end frameworks. Its design allows for fast development setups for various JavaScript frameworks, including but not limited to React.

Vite's core advantage lies in its use of native ES modules, which enables it to provide extremely fast server start and hot module replacement (HMR). This makes Vite an efficient tool for developing modern web applications. Although Vite works exceptionally well with Vue.js (since it was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js), it is equally capable of supporting React, Svelte, and other JavaScript or TypeScript-based frameworks.

Vite achieves this flexibility through its plugin system, allowing it to tailor the development environment to the specific needs of the framework in use. For example, when used with React, Vite can leverage plugins designed for React to optimize the development and build process.

In summary, while Vite is often associated with Vue.js due to its origins, it is a general-purpose build tool that can be effectively used with a variety of frameworks, including React.
