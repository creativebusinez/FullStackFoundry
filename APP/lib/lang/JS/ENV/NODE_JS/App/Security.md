3. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Middleware**
   - Description: CORS middleware helps manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Express.js applications, allowing you to specify which origins are permitted to access resources on your server.
   - CLI Command: `npm install cors`

4. **csurf (Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection)**
   - Description: The csurf middleware provides protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by adding CSRF tokens to forms and verifying them on incoming requests.
   - CLI Command: `npm install csurf`

5. **Express-validator**
   - Description: Express-validator is a middleware for request data validation in Express.js applications. It helps sanitize and validate user inputs, preventing security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
   - CLI Command: `npm install express-validator`

6. **Helmet Crossdomain**
   - Description: Helmet Crossdomain is an extension of the Helmet middleware that helps protect your site against Adobe Flash-based attacks by setting the Crossdomain XML policy file headers.
