# Authorization

Here's a high-level list of popular authorization libraries and modules for Node.js, along with descriptions and associated CLI commands for installation:

**Authorization Libraries:**

1. **jsonwebtoken**
   - Description: jsonwebtoken is a library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for authentication and authorization in Node.js applications. It allows you to implement token-based authorization.
   - CLI Command: `npm install jsonwebtoken`

2. **Access Control Lists (ACL) Libraries**
   - Description: Libraries like `acl`, `accesscontrol`, and `casbin` provide fine-grained access control and role-based authorization features for Node.js applications, allowing you to define and manage permissions.
   - CLI Command (e.g., `acl`): `npm install acl`

3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Libraries**
   - Description: RBAC libraries like `node-rbac` and `node-role-acl` offer role-based authorization solutions for Node.js applications. They help define and enforce access policies based on user roles.
   - CLI Command (e.g., `node-rbac`): `npm install node-rbac`

4. **OAuth Libraries**
   - Description: OAuth libraries like `oauth2orize` provide tools for implementing OAuth 2.0-based authorization flows in Node.js applications. They are useful when integrating with OAuth providers like Google or Facebook.
   - CLI Command (e.g., `oauth2orize`): `npm install oauth2orize`

5. **RBAC and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) Libraries**
   - Description: Libraries like `abac` and `node-abac-pm` extend access control with attribute-based policies, allowing you to make authorization decisions based on object attributes.
   - CLI Command (e.g., `abac`): `npm install abac`

These authorization libraries and modules provide essential functionality for controlling access to resources and defining permissions in your Node.js applications. The choice of library depends on your project's specific authorization requirements and development preferences.
