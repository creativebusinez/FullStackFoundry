Creating a Node.js project with Express involves several steps. Below is a guide to get you started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
   - Run `npm init`. This command will prompt you to enter several pieces of information (like the project's name, version, etc.). You can either fill these out or press Enter to accept defaults. This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.

3. **Install Express**:
   - In the terminal, run `npm install express --save`. This command installs Express and adds it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

4. **Create Your Main Application File**:
   - Create a file named `app.js` (or another name of your choice) in your project directory. This will be your main server file.
   - Open `app.js` in a text editor and write the basic Express server code. Here's a simple example:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

5. **Run the Server**:
   - Back in the terminal, run `node app.js` (replace `app.js` with your file name if different).
   - Your server should start, and you should see a message like `Example app listening at http://localhost:3000`.
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your "Hello World!" message.

6. **Optional - Nodemon for Development**:
   - During development, you might want `app.js` to automatically reload whenever you make changes. You can achieve this with Nodemon.
   - Install Nodemon globally by running `npm install -g nodemon`.
   - Instead of starting your server with `node app.js`, use `nodemon app.js`.

7. **Expand Your Project**:
   - You can now add more routes, middleware, and other functionalities to your Express app as needed.

8. **Version Control (Optional)**:
   - It's a good practice to use version control with your project. You can initialize a Git repository in your project directory by running `git init`.

Remember, this is just a basic setup. As your application grows, you might want to consider additional setup like environment variable management, more complex routing, using a view engine, connecting to a database, and setting up a proper project structure.
