Creating the best tech stack compatible with Next.js involves considering a few key factors such as scalability, performance, and ease of development. Next.js, a framework built on top of React, offers server-side rendering and static site generation, making it a powerful tool for building efficient, fast-loading web applications. Here's an example of an optimal tech stack that pairs well with Next.js:

1. **Front-end Framework: Next.js/React**
   - Next.js itself serves as the core of your front-end, leveraging React for building user interfaces.

2. **Programming Language: TypeScript**
   - TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability, which is particularly beneficial in large-scale applications.

3. **State Management: Redux or Context API**
   - For complex applications, Redux can be a good choice for managing application state. For simpler scenarios, React's Context API might suffice.

4. **CSS-in-JS Solution: Styled-components or Tailwind CSS**
   - Styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling. These tools allow for writing CSS directly within JavaScript, which fits well with the component-based architecture of React/Next.js.

5. **Back-end Framework: Node.js with Express**
   - Node.js, particularly with the Express framework, aligns well with Next.js, allowing you to build a full JavaScript stack. This streamlines development since both the front-end and back-end use JavaScript.

6. **Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL**
   - MongoDB is a great choice if you prefer a NoSQL database, particularly for applications with large amounts of unstructured data. PostgreSQL is an excellent option for relational database needs, known for its robustness and performance.

7. **Authentication: NextAuth.js or Auth0**
   - NextAuth.js is specifically designed for Next.js applications, providing a simple solution for authentication. Auth0 is another powerful tool for managing authentication and can be easily integrated with Next.js.

8. **APIs: RESTful API or GraphQL**
   - Depending on your preference and the nature of your application, you can opt for a RESTful API (using Express.js) or GraphQL.

9. **Server/Deployment: Vercel or AWS**
   - Vercel, created by the same team behind Next.js, offers seamless deployment for Next.js applications. Alternatively, AWS provides a more flexible and scalable environment.

10. **Version Control: Git with GitHub/GitLab**
    - Git for version control, with GitHub or GitLab as the repository hosting service. This setup is crucial for collaborative development and CI/CD integrations.

11. **Testing Framework: Jest and React Testing Library**
    - Jest, along with the React Testing Library, provides a solid testing framework that works well with Next.js for both unit and integration testing.

12. **CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins**
    - For continuous integration and deployment, GitHub Actions integrates well with GitHub repositories. Jenkins is an alternative that offers more customizable pipelines.

This tech stack ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient development environment, catering to the modern needs of web application development with Next.js. Remember, the best stack for your project can vary depending on specific requirements, team expertise, and the nature of the application you're building.
