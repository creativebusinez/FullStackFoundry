This directory structure is a high-level overview. Actual implementations can have more depth or complexity depending on the specific needs and scale of the website. For example, each product or service category could have multiple subcategories or individual product/service pages. Also, blogs and resources sections could be expanded with numerous articles, each in its appropriate category.
