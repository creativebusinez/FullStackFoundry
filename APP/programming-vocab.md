       if (props.isLoggedIn) {
           return <p>Welcome back!</p>;
       } else {
           return <p>Please sign in.</p>;
       }
   }
   ```

9. **Component Lifecycle**: The sequence of phases a component goes through, from creation to updating and unmounting, with associated lifecycle methods.
   Example:

   ```jsx
   componentDidMount() {
       // Code to run after the component has been rendered
   }

   componentDidUpdate() {
       // Code to run after the component has updated
   }

   componentWillUnmount() {
       // Code to clean up before the component is removed
   }
   ```

10. **State Management (e.g., Redux)**: Libraries and patterns used for managing application state in larger React applications, ensuring data consistency and predictability.
    Example (Redux):

    ```jsx
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    ```

11. **Router (e.g., React Router)**: Libraries for handling client-side routing and navigation in React applications.
    Example (React Router):

    ```jsx
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    ```

12. **Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect)**: Functions that allow functional components to use state and side effects without writing class-based components.
    Example (useState Hook):

    ```jsx
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

13. **Context API**: A built-in way to manage state that can be accessed by multiple components without passing props through intermediate components.
    Example (Creating and Using Context):

    ```jsx
    const MyContext = React.createContext();

    <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
        {/* Components can consume context */}
    </MyContext.Provider>
    ```

14. **Props Destructuring**: A technique to simplify the usage of props by extracting specific values directly in the function parameters or component body.
    Example (Destructuring Props):

    ```jsx
    function Greeting({ name }) {
        return <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
    }
    ```

15. **Higher-Order Component (HOC)**: A pattern in React where a function takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional functionality.
    Example:

    ```jsx
    const withLogging = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return class extends React.Component {
            componentDidMount() {
                console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} mounted.`);
            }

            render() {
                return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
            }
        };
    };

    const EnhancedComponent = withLogging(MyComponent);
    ```

16. **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different content based on conditions, often using ternary operators or logical `&&` operators.
    Example (Ternary Operator):

    ```jsx
    function Greeting(props) {
        return (
            <div>
                {props.isLoggedIn ? (
                    <p>Welcome back!</p>
                ) : (
                    <p>Please sign in.</p>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

17. **CSS-in-JS**: A technique to style React components by embedding CSS directly in JavaScript using libraries like styled-components.
    Example (styled-components):

    ```jsx
    import styled from 'styled-components';

    const Button = styled.button`
        background-color: blue;
        color: white;
        font-size: 16px;
    `;
    ```

18. **React Fragments**: A way to group multiple elements without adding an additional parent element to the DOM.
    Example (Using Fragments):

    ```jsx
    function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <>
                <p>First paragraph</p>
                <p>Second paragraph</p>
            </>
        );
    }
    ```

19. **React Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect)**: Built-in functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects.
    Example (useState Hook):

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

20. **React Context**: A mechanism for sharing state and data between components without passing props explicitly.
    Example (Using React Context):

    ```jsx
    const MyContext = React.createContext();

    function MyProvider({ children }) {
        const sharedData = 'Shared Data';

        return (
            <MyContext.Provider value={sharedData}>
                {children}
            </MyContext.Provider>
        );
    }

    function MyComponent() {
        const contextData = React.useContext(MyContext);
        return <p>{contextData}</p>;
    }
    ```

21. **React Router**: A library for handling client-side routing and navigation in React applications.
    Example (Using React Router):

    ```jsx
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    function App() {
        return (
            <Router>
                <nav>
                    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                    <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                </nav>

                <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
                <Route path="/about" component={About} />
            </Router>
        );
    }
    ```

22. **Redux**: A state management library for managing the global state of a React application and facilitating predictable data flow.
   Example (Using Redux):

   ```jsx
   // Redux store setup
   import { createStore } from 'redux';
   const store = createStore(reducer);

   // Connecting a component to Redux
   import { connect } from 'react-redux';

   const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
       return {
           count: state.count,
       };
   };

   const MyComponent = ({ count, dispatch }) => (
       <div>
           <p>Count: {count}</p>
           <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
       </div>
   );

   export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
   ```

1. **React Hooks (useContext, useRef, etc.)**: A variety of built-in hooks provided by React to manage different aspects of component behavior.
   Example (useContext Hook):

   ```jsx
   import React, { useContext } from 'react';

   const MyContext = React.createContext();

   function MyComponent() {
       const contextData = useContext(MyContext);
       return <p>{contextData}</p>;
   }
   ```

2. **Redux Thunk**: A middleware for Redux that allows asynchronous actions to be dispatched, enabling complex side effects and async logic.
   Example (Using Redux Thunk):

   ```jsx
   const fetchPosts = () => {
       return (dispatch) => {
           dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' });
           fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
               .then((response) => response.json())
               .then((data) => {
                   dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', payload: data });
               })
               .catch((error) => {
                   dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE', payload: error });
               });
       };
   };
   ```

3. **React Portals**: A feature in React that allows rendering a component at a different DOM location outside of its parent hierarchy.
   Example (Using Portals):

   ```jsx
   const MyPortalComponent = () => {
       return ReactDOM.createPortal(
           <div>This content is rendered outside the parent component.</div>,
           document.getElementById('portal-root')
       );
   };
   ```

4. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: A pattern in React for creating reusable component logic by wrapping components with functions.
   Example (Creating an HOC):

   ```jsx
   const withDataFetching = (WrappedComponent) => {
       // Logic for fetching data
       return class extends React.Component {
           // ...
       };
   };

   const MyComponentWithData = withDataFetching(MyComponent);
   ```

5. **React Testing (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)**: Libraries and tools for testing React components and ensuring code quality.
   Example (Testing with Jest and React Testing Library):

   ```jsx
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   test('renders a component', () => {
       render(<MyComponent />);
       const element = screen.getByText('Hello, React!');
       expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

6. **Lazy Loading**: A technique for optimizing performance by loading components or resources only when they are needed.
   Example (Lazy Loading with React's Suspense):

   ```jsx
   const MyLazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));

   function App() {
       return (
           <div>
               <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                   <MyLazyComponent />
               </React.Suspense>
           </div>
       );
   }
   ```

7. **Styled-components**: A popular library for styling React components by writing CSS within JavaScript using tagged template literals.
   Example (Styled-components):

   ```jsx
   import styled from 'styled-components';

   const Button = styled.button`
       background-color: blue;
       color: white;
       font-size: 16px;
   `;
   ```
